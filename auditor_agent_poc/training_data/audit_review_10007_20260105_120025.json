This suggests that the LTV might be higher than what is typically allowed.\n\n### **Compliance Checks**\nUnfortunately, there were technical issues with the compliance checker tool, and I was unable to retrieve specific policy limits and requirements. However, based on the rejection reason provided in the application data, it can be inferred that the LTV of 93.78% exceeds the allowable limit for the mortgage product.\n\n### **Final Recommendation**\n- **Action Required**: The application cannot be submitted as is due to the high LTV, which has already led to a previous rejection. It is recommended to either increase the down payment to reduce the LTV or consider a different mortgage product that accommodates a higher LTV. Further compliance checks should be performed once the technical issues with the compliance checker tool are resolved to ensure all other aspects meet the lender's policies."
